## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ **A bit about us...**

We provide unique capital markets intelligence and guidance to issuers and their advisors. 

Our intelligence and insights consistently make the difference in the success of deals, AGMs, activist defences, IR strategies and proxy battles. We identify investors that others don’t. We provide unrivalled expertise to put the intelligence into context. And ultimately, we give you the edge you need to win. 

This means the inherent risk involved in your most important IR, transactional and proxy events is reduced. You have something the other side doesn’t.
